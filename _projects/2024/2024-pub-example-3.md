  Designed a data acquisition system using a SingleBoard Computer (SBC) and Python to monitor ultrasonic welding machines in real-time. Storedperformance metrics in MySQL. Built a React Native mobile app for operator time logging andintegrated it with machine data to calculate shift-wise performance and efficiency. Developed aresponsive dashboard using NodeJS, ReactJS, and Redux to visualize KPIs and machine health.
