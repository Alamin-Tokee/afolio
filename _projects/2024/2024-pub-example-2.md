  Developed a full-stack monitoring system for real-time analytics of power press machines using Python, Siemens PLCs, and MQTT. Stored production and efficiency data in a MySQL backend. Built a dynamic dashboard with PHP, AJAX, JavaScript, and jQuery to provide actionable insights on equipment performance, downtime, and operator productivity.
